Over the  years, I've consistently spoken about the inappropriateness of pursuing work-life balance. The thing being, life is not about work, and work isn't about life. Life, in itself, is something each being moves through, ebbing and flowing forward.

## Work-life balance doesn't exist
A balanced teeter-totter is boring. Pursuing balance is a futile effort, constantly working towards something that's unachievable. One event can throw everything out of whack and the stress of being imbalance can make things even worse.

This phrase creates false separation of living one's life and doing your life's work. As humans, most of us can't switch into "work mode" and disregard all the bits of life that influence what we bring into work.

It's detrimental to individuals, disregarding the complexity of being human. We are dynamic, complex beings filled with emotion, thought, and flow.

There's more to life than work, though work is a necessity to sustain our lives.

## Boundaries are Better than Balance
We have a finite amount of time and energy. To continue doing—day to day, month to month, year to year—we have to be purposeful of that energy.

If we use all our spoons at work, we lose the spoons for others. We can't grow in capacity, _doing_ more, if we don't have the energy needed to keep it up.

Listening to yourself, understanding one's bounds &  needs, and setting those boundaries is extremely difficult. When we have none, it all becomes unsustainable and overwhelming. We quickly progress towards burnout, overwork, and misunderstood expectations.

## Lessons from Moss
I'm a big fan of the [Ologies podcast by Alie Ward](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/). Every podcast is filled with delightful and interesting science, made much more enjoyable by the Alie's enthusiasm: on the science itself and her excitement to interview interesting people studying interesting things.

One of the most impactful episodes was with [Dr. Robin Wall Kimmerer on Bryology](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/bryology), "a world-renowned author, botanist, Indigenous ecology professor and byrologist." I can't recommend this podcast enough, but _this episode_: give it a good listen.

Once; twice; thrice.

Moss is an extraordinary plant. There was one moment that struck and stuck&emdash;HA! Puns&emdash;a chord.

Mosses can grow on anything because of how they attach themselves to objects. They grow _everywhere_ because they take advantage of physics, using extremely thin boundary layers, operating in the stillness, capturing moisture to germinate, spread, and grow.

Dr. Killemer describes them as:
> A little green house that occurs naturally over every surface, a place which is warmer, moister, and as it happens, richer in carbon dioxide than any place else, and that's where the mosses live. They’re exploiting these little microhabitats, rather than trying to dominate and control the habitat, they're taking advantage of the laws of physics and exploiting these naturally occurring little greenhouses.

They're using these boundary layers to thrive in extreme hostile environments, the first to "colonize land 350 million years ago." Sophisticated simplicity.


## Boundaries are powerful.
Only the individual has the power to create, define, and communicate my own bounds of work & life.

- They require reflection to create for one's self.
- They're the limits, lines that _we_ say can or can not be crossed.
- They manage personal expectations and the expectations others put onto us.
- When set, they foster respect for self, equally respecting other's.
- With them, we operate towards equilibrium—not constantly pursuing unattainable balance.
- When set, operating within them, we create the micro-habitats to thrive.


## Be like moss. Use layer boundaries to create a greenhouse, creating _your_ environment towards something better than solely work & life.
